There are N workers.  The i-th worker has a quality[i] and a minimum wage expectation wage[i].

Now we want to hire exactly K workers to form a paid group.  When hiring a group of K workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:

Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.
Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
Return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.

 

Example 1:

Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], K = 2
Output: 105.00000
Explanation: We pay 70 to 0-th worker and 35 to 2-th worker.


the key point is sorting the ratio wage/quality because the final ratio in the group must be equal
we want the ratio as small as possible
when get the kth ratio, we calculate the total wage use totalQ*ratio
then we remove the biggest quality which contribute most wage and get the next ratio


class Solution {
    public double mincostToHireWorkers(int[] quality, int[] wage, int K) {
        double[][] ratioSorted = new double[quality.length][2];
        for (int i = 0; i<quality.length; i++) {
            ratioSorted[i][0] = (double)quality[i];
            ratioSorted[i][1] = (double)wage[i] / (double)quality[i];
        }
        /*
        Comparator<double[]> cmp = new Comparator<double[]>(){
            public int compare(double[] a, double[] b) {
                return Double.compare(a[1] - b[1]);
            }
        };
        */
        Arrays.sort(ratioSorted, (a, b) -> Double.compare(a[1], b[1]) );
        PriorityQueue<Double> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        double res = Double.MAX_VALUE, sum = 0;
        
        for (double[] n : ratioSorted) {
            sum += n[0];
            pq.offer(n[0]);
            
            if (pq.size() == K) {
                res = Math.min(res, sum*n[1]);
                sum -= pq.poll();
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
