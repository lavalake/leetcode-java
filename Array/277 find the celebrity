public class Solution extends Relation {
    public int findCelebrity(int n) {
        int candidate = 0;
        for (int i=1; i<n; i++) {
            if (knows(candidate, i)) candidate = i;
        }
        
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if (i != candidate && knows(candidate, i) || !knows(i, candidate)) return -1;
        }
        return candidate;
    }
}
