Just think about the current root, after processing, it will need to return [smaller/eq, larger] subtrees

if root.val <=V, all nodes under root.left(including root) will be in the smaller/eq tree,
we then split the root.right subtree into smaller/eq, larger, the root will need to concat the smaller/eq from the subproblem result (recursion).

Similarly for the case root.val>V
