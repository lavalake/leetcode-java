1. Subsets
https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/description/
subSets, it's similar with combination, the order does not matter. the difference is every set is added to the final list.
  not only length to target. So the implimentaion is slightly different with combination.
  ret.add(subSet)
  from start to num
    subSet.add(start)
    helper(i+1)
    subSet.remove(list.size()-1)
2. Subsets II
    this quetion may contains duplicated in nums. So two points:
    1. need sort the nums first
    2. need to skip duplicate nums when we go through
        for (int i=pos; i<nums.length; i++) {
            if (i > pos && nums[i]==nums[i-1]) continue;
            subSet.add(nums[i]);
            helper(nums, i+1, ret, subSet);
            subSet.remove(subSet.size()-1);
        }
