1. 一般DFS用于输出所有情况，然后如果是问能不能一般都用DFS+全局变量，DFS来更新全局变量。
2. Permutaion vs combination vs subSets
  Permutaion, the order matters. So we need for loop from **start** for every iteration call to helper function.
  the point is swap every node with cur node, and calculate the remaining permutaion without current node.
  from start to num
    swap(cur, i)
    **helper(start+1)
    swap(cur, i)
  Combination, the order does not maters. So we need to loop from i not start for every helper call. This is the difference
  with permutaions.
  the therey is pick one from the num, then pick (k-1) from the remaining number. Because order does not matter. so we do not
  need to start from start index, all the preceeding numbers has already been checked. So we only need to check from i+1 in
  the remaining numbers.
  from start to num
    list.add(start)
    helper(i+1)
    list.remove(list.size()-1)
    
  subSets, it's similar with combination, the order does not matter. the difference is every set is added to the final list.
  not only length to target. So the implimentaion is slightly different with combination.
  ret.add(subSet)
  from start to num
    subSet.add(start)
    helper(i+1)
    subSet.remove(list.size()-1)
