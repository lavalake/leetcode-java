For each house, find its position between those heaters (thus we need the heaters array to be sorted).
Calculate the distances between this house and left heater and right heater, get a MIN value of those two values. Corner cases are there is no left or right heater.
Get MAX value among distances in step 2. It's the answer.
So use binnarySearch to find the closed heater index for every house, then calculate the distance and remember the max distance.
Arrays.binnarySearch() return (-(insert index)-1)
