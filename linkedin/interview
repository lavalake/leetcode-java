1. virtual memory
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory
virtual memory (also virtual storage) is a memory management technique that provides an abstraction of the physical 
memory that are actually available on a given machine
The computer's operating system, using a combination of hardware and software, maps memory addresses used by a program,
called virtual addresses, into physical addresses in computer memory

a memory management unit or MMU, automatically translates virtual addresses to physical addresses
The primary benefits of virtual memory include freeing applications from having to manage a shared memory space, 
increased security due to memory isolation, and being able to conceptually use more memory than might be physically 
available, using the technique of paging

2. process vs thread
Process
Process is a running program on CPU. A process has seperate a virtual address space, other resources,
Thread
A thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution. All threads of a process share its 
virtual address space and system resources

3. polymorphism refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their actual type
at run time. Different subclass can have diffent implementation of the method. And you can have a base class referece to 
subclass and will call the subclass method implementaion at run time.
