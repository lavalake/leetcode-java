there are two method to solve this one:
O(n) just OR every element, the remaining nmuber is the it.
O(logn) use binnary search, for example
  1 2 2 3 3
  1 1 2 2 3
0 1 1 2 2 3 3
for first one, the mid number is 2, compare with left and right side, we found the single element should be in left.
for seconde one, the mid number is 2, compare with left and right, the single element should be in right
如果当前数字出现两次的话，我们可以通过数组的长度跟当前位置的关系，计算出右边和当前数字不同的数字的总个数，如果是偶数个，说明落单数左半边，反之则在右半边
