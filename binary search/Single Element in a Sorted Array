there are two method to solve this one:
O(n) just OR every element, the remaining nmuber is the it.
O(logn) use binnary search, for example
1 2 2 3 3
1 1 2 2 3
for first one, the mid number is 2, compare with left and right side, we found the single element should be in left.
for seconde one, the mid number is 2, compare with left and right, the single element should be in right
