Notice two important things about the initialization routine in Listing 5-7. First, it is defined with the __init macro. As we saw earlier, this macro applies the section attribute to declare that this function gets placed into a section called .init.text in the vmlinux ELF file. Recall that the purpose of placing this function into a special section of the object file is so the memory space that it occupies can be reclaimed when it is no longer needed.
