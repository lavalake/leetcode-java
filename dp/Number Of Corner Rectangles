brutal force:
for loops, col=0,n-1
            row=0,m-1
              find first 1
              row2=row+1,n
              find next 1 in this row
                col2=col+1,n
                find if col2,row and col2,row2 are 1
Optimization:
we can save one loop, using trick count*(count-1)/2
calculate every two row together, if they have the same col as 1, count++
row=0,n
  row1=row+1,n
    col=0,m
      if(row,col && row1,col) count++
