1. brutal force, recursive
from 1 to n, pick every number as root, then recursivly count the tree of the left and right nums.
class Solution {
    public int numTrees(int n) {
        return countNum(1,n,n);
    }
    private int countNum(int start, int end, int num) {
        if (start > end || start < 1 || end > num) return 0;
        if (start==end) return 1;
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i=start; i<=end; i++) {
            int left = countNum(start, i-1, num);
            int right = countNum(i+1, end, num);
            if (left != 0 && right != 0) cnt += left*right;
            else cnt += left + right;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}

2. memorization top down
class Solution {
    public int numTrees(int n) {
        Map<pair,Integer> mem = new HashMap<>();
        return countNum(1,n,n,mem);
    }
    private int countNum(int start, int end, int num, Map<pair,Integer> mem) {
        if (start > end || start < 1 || end > num) return 0;
        if (start==end) return 1;
        pair newPair = new pair(start ,end);
        if (mem.containsKey(newPair)) return mem.get(newPair);
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i=start; i<=end; i++) {
            int left = countNum(start, i-1, num, mem);
            int right = countNum(i+1, end, num, mem);
            if (left != 0 && right != 0) cnt += left*right;
            else cnt += left + right;
        }
        mem.put(newPair, cnt);
        return cnt;
    }
    public static class pair {
        public int start, end;
        public pair(int start, int end) {
            this.start = start;
            this.end = end;
        }
        @Override
        public boolean equals(Object comp) {
            if (this == comp) return true;
            if (comp == null) return false;
            if (getClass() != comp.getClass()) return false;
            pair p = (pair) comp;
            return this.start==p.start && this.end==p.end;
        }
        @Override
        public int hashCode() {
            return start+end;
        }
    }
}
可以优化。因为start，end不重要，end-start是我们需要的。所以map可以定义为Map<Integer,Integer>
if (mem.containsKey(end-start+1)) return mem.get(end-start+1);

class Solution {
    public int numTrees(int n) {
        int[] mem = new int[n+1];
        mem[0] = 1;
        mem[1] = 1;
        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {
            for (int j=1; j<=i; j++) {
                mem[i] += mem[j-1] * mem[i-j];
            }
        }
        return mem[n];
    }

}
The problem can be solved in a dynamic programming way. I’ll explain the intuition and formulas in the following.

Given a sequence 1…n, to construct a Binary Search Tree (BST) out of the sequence, we could enumerate each number i in the sequence, and use the number as the root, naturally, the subsequence 1…(i-1) on its left side would lay on the left branch of the root, and similarly the right subsequence (i+1)…n lay on the right branch of the root. We then can construct the subtree from the subsequence recursively. Through the above approach, we could ensure that the BST that we construct are all unique, since they have unique roots.

The problem is to calculate the number of unique BST. To do so, we need to define two functions:

G(n): the number of unique BST for a sequence of length n.

F(i, n), 1 <= i <= n: the number of unique BST, where the number i is the root of BST, and the sequence ranges from 1 to n.

As one can see, G(n) is the actual function we need to calculate in order to solve the problem. And G(n) can be derived from F(i, n), which at the end, would recursively refer to G(n).

First of all, given the above definitions, we can see that the total number of unique BST G(n), is the sum of BST F(i) using each number i as a root.
i.e.

G(n) = F(1, n) + F(2, n) + ... + F(n, n). 
Particularly, the bottom cases, there is only one combination to construct a BST out of a sequence of length 1 (only a root) or 0 (empty tree).
i.e.

G(0)=1, G(1)=1. 
Given a sequence 1…n, we pick a number i out of the sequence as the root, then the number of unique BST with the specified root F(i), is the cartesian product of the number of BST for its left and right subtrees. For example, F(3, 7): the number of unique BST tree with number 3 as its root. To construct an unique BST out of the entire sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] with 3 as the root, which is to say, we need to construct an unique BST out of its left subsequence [1, 2] and another BST out of the right subsequence [4, 5, 6, 7], and then combine them together (i.e. cartesian product). The tricky part is that we could consider the number of unique BST out of sequence [1,2] as G(2), and the number of of unique BST out of sequence [4, 5, 6, 7] as G(4). Therefore, F(3,7) = G(2) * G(4).

i.e.

F(i, n) = G(i-1) * G(n-i)	1 <= i <= n 
Combining the above two formulas, we obtain the recursive formula for G(n). i.e.

G(n) = G(0) * G(n-1) + G(1) * G(n-2) + … + G(n-1) * G(0) 
In terms of calculation, we need to start with the lower number, since the value of G(n) depends on the values of G(0) … G(n-1).

Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : the main computation of the algorithm is done at the statement with G[i]. So the time complexity is 
essentially the number of iterations for the statement, which is \sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \frac{(2+n)(n-1)}{2}∑ 
i=2
n
​	
 i= 
2
(2+n)(n−1)
​	
 , to be exact, therefore the time complexity is O(N^2)O(N 
2
 )

Space complexity : The space complexity of the above algorithm is mainly the storage to keep all the intermediate solutions, 
therefore O(N)O(N).
