  In graph theory, a bridge, isthmus, cut-edge, or cut arc is an edge of a graph whose deletion increases its number of connected
components.[1] Equivalently, an edge is a bridge if and only if it is not contained in any cycle. 
  A graph is said to be bridgeless or isthmus-free if it contains no bridges
Trees and forests[edit]
  Tree means fully connected and no cycle.
  Forest not necessary fully connected and no cycle
  A graph with n nodes can contain at most n-1 bridges, since adding additional edges must create a cycle. 
  The graphs with exactly n-1 bridges are exactly the trees, 
  and the graphs in which every edge is a bridge are exactly the forests.
