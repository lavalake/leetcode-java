There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

Example 1:

Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

We take ratings array as [5, 6, 2, 2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 4, 0, 5, 1]
In the given problem each student will have at least 1 candy. So distribute 1 candy to each.

ratings:     [5, 6, 2, 2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 4, 0, 5, 1]
candies:     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Now traverse the array from left to right. If the rating of (n+1) child is greater than (n) child then set the candy of (n+1) child as one candy more than the (n) child candies.

ratings:     [5, 6, 2, 2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 4, 0, 5, 1]
candies:     [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1]
Now traverse the array from right to left. If the (n) child rating is more than (n+1) child and (n) child candies is less than one more than (n+1) child candies then update the candies of (n) child as 1+ (n+1) candies.

ratings:     [5, 6, 2, 2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 4, 0, 5, 1]
candies:     [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
Total minimum candies: 23

public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int sum=0;
        int[] a=new int[ratings.length];
        for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++)
        {
            a[i]=1;
        }
        for(int i=0;i<ratings.length-1;i++)
        {
            if(ratings[i+1]>ratings[i])
            {
                a[i+1]=a[i]+1;
            }
        }
        for(int i=ratings.length-1;i>0;i--)
        {
            if(ratings[i-1]>ratings[i])
            {
                if(a[i-1]<(a[i]+1))
                {
                    a[i-1]=a[i]+1;
                }
            }
        }
        for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++)
        {
            sum+=a[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }

This solution picks each element from the input array only once. First, we give a candy to the first child. Then for each child we have three cases:

His/her rating is equal to the previous one -> give 1 candy.
His/her rating is greater than the previous one -> give him (previous + 1) candies.
His/her rating is less than the previous one -> don't know what to do yet, let's just count the number of such consequent cases.
When we enter 1 or 2 condition we can check our count from 3. If it's not zero then we know that we were descending before and we have everything to update our total candies amount: number of children in descending sequence of raitings - coundDown, number of candies given at peak - prev (we don't update prev when descending). Total number of candies for "descending" children can be found through arithmetic progression formula (1+2+...+countDown). Plus we need to update our peak child if his number of candies is less then or equal to countDown.

class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int total = 1, peak = 1, descCount = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i<ratings.length; i++) {
            if (ratings[i] >= ratings[i-1]) {
                if (descCount != 0) {
                    total += descCount*(descCount+1)/2;
                    if (peak <= descCount) {
                        total += descCount - peak + 1;
                    }
                    descCount = 0;
                    peak = 1;
                }
                //here !!!if equal, we can reset the peak to 1
                peak = ratings[i] == ratings[i-1]?1:peak+1;
                total += peak;
                
            } else {

            }
