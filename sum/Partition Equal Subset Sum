416. Partition Equal Subset Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-equal-subset-sum/description/
Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.
This question can be solved using 10 kackpack.
calculate the average, then this is the target. try all number, see can be reached to target by picking any nums.
So target is the bag, nums are object.
i = 0, num.length
  j = target, nums[j]
    dp[j] = dp[j]?dp[j]:dp[j-nums[i]]
this is space optimized. dp[j] -> dp[i-1][j] because the inner loop start from back to front. dp[j] is the previous round
value, say dp[i-1][j]
class Solution {
    public boolean canPartition(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length==0) return false;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
            sum += n;
        }
        if (sum%2 != 0) return false;
        
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[sum/2+1];
        dp[0] = true;
        
            for (int j=0; j<nums.length; j++) {
                for (int i=sum/2; i>=nums[j]; i--) {
                    dp[i] = dp[i]?dp[i]:dp[i-nums[j]];
                }
                
            }
        
        return dp[sum/2];
    }
}
