Comparator Vs Comparable

The Comparable interface is a good choice when used for defining the default ordering or, in other words, if it’s the main way of comparing objects.

Then, we must ask ourselves why use a Comparator if we already have Comparable?

There are several reasons why:

Sometimes, we can’t modify the source code of the class whose objects we want to sort, thus making the use of Comparable impossible
Using Comparators allows us to avoid adding additional code to our domain classes
We can define multiple different comparison strategies which isn’t possible when using Comparable
